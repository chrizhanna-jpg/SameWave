# Workspace

## Overview

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9
- **API framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Artifacts

### Same Same (Mobile App — brand "Echo", tagline "same same")
- **Type**: Expo (React Native)
- **Location**: `artifacts/same-same/`
- **Preview**: `/` (root)
- **Purpose**: Global visual matching game — post a daily-life photo, swipe through others, celebrate matches with strangers elsewhere. No text chat — connection is via opt-in anonymous social-handle exchange.

#### Features:
- Onboarding flow (3 steps with globe animation)
- Swipe screen: two photos side by side, swipe left/right to judge similarity
- Reveal screen: countries revealed, similarity score meter, country animation
- World Map: fill in countries as you match, region breakdown
- Profile: badges system, match history (Same Same / Recent Different), photo gallery
- Camera/upload: take a photo or pick from library for daily challenges
- Connect requests: opt-in anonymous handle exchange after a match
- AsyncStorage for local UI state; backend for the shared photo pool

#### Key Files:
- `app/_layout.tsx` — root layout with providers
- `app/index.tsx` — redirect to onboarding or tabs
- `app/onboarding.tsx` — 3-step onboarding
- `app/(tabs)/match.tsx` — main swipe screen (real candidates in production, synthetic in dev)
- `app/(tabs)/map.tsx` — world map
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` — profile/stats
- `app/reveal.tsx` — post-swipe reveal
- `app/camera.tsx` — photo upload (also fire-and-forget uploads to backend)
- `context/AppContext.tsx` — global UI state with AsyncStorage
- `utils/api.ts` — backend client (deviceId auth, uploadPhoto, fetchCandidates, votePhoto, reportPhoto)
- `data/samplePhotos.ts` — dev-only sample/synthetic photo generator (gated by `ENABLE_SYNTHETIC_MATCHES` = `__DEV__`)
- `constants/colors.ts` — dark theme (navy + coral + teal)

### API Server
- **Type**: Express (TypeScript) on `artifacts/api-server/`
- **Endpoints powering Echo**:
  - `POST /api/analyze-photo` — Gemini-powered theme + tags from an image
  - `POST /api/photos` — upload (analyze + persist with 30-day TTL)
  - `GET  /api/photos/candidates` — ranked match pool, excludes own/voted/expired/over-reported
  - `POST /api/photos/:id/vote` — record a same/different verdict
  - `POST /api/photos/:id/report` — flag a photo (3 reports → hidden pending review)

## Photo Storage Architecture (Phase 1)

- **Identity**: anonymous device ID (UUID generated client-side, persisted in AsyncStorage, sent as `X-Device-Id` header). Resolved server-side to a `users` row. Clerk Google sign-in is planned for Phase 2.
- **Storage**: photos are kept as base64 inline in the `photos.bytes_base64` column with an 8 MB binary cap. Object storage is the next-step migration when scale demands it.
- **Schema** (`lib/db/src/schema/`): `users`, `photos`, `votes`, `reports`. Photos carry `theme` (text), `tags` (text[]), `country_code`, `expires_at` (now + 30 days), `status` (active/removed/pending_review), `report_count`, and an unused `embedding vector(768)` column reserved for a future similarity-search upgrade.
- **Matching**: SQL-based scoring on tag overlap + theme equality/substring with a small random jitter for ordering variety. The Replit Gemini AI Integrations proxy does **not** support embeddings (`embedContent` returns `INVALID_ENDPOINT`), so the `pgvector` column stays nullable and unused for now — wire OpenAI embeddings (or another provider) in if/when fuzzier matching is needed.
- **Moderation**: report-based hiding (`REPORT_HIDE_THRESHOLD = 3`). The `reports` table has a unique `(reporter_user_id, photo_id)` index and the report endpoint uses `onConflictDoNothing` + skips the count bump on conflict, so the threshold can only be reached by 3 distinct reporters. Pre-upload Gemini safety check is Phase 2.
- **Retention**: 30 days for free users (Pro paywall + extended retention is Phase 3). A background expiry job is also Phase 3 — for now `expires_at` filtering at query time is sufficient.

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally
